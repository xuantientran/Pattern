Visitor pattern is used for separation of Business logic and algorithm from an object data structure i.e. it is used for separating logic from actual data structure.
Thanks to the separation of data structure and its logic we can add new logic without changing the current data structure and vice-versa.
Visitor Pattern represent an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure. Visitor lets you define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates (as per GOF).
